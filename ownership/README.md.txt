### 🔑 Ownership Concept
- Ownership is Rust’s unique way of **managing memory without a garbage collector**.
- The **rules**:
  1. Each value has a single *owner*.
  2. There can only be one owner at a time.
  3. When the owner goes out of scope, the value is automatically dropped.

This guarantees **memory safety** at compile time with zero runtime cost.

### 📦 Stack vs Heap
- **Stack**: fast, ordered (last in, first out), holds fixed-size data.
- **Heap**: less organized, used for dynamically sized data (e.g. `String`).
- Managing heap memory is Rust’s main reason for ownership.

---

### 📝 Scope
- A variable is valid **from its declaration until the end of its scope**.
- When scope ends, Rust calls `drop` automatically to free memory (similar to RAII in C++).

---

### 📚 The `String` Type
- Unlike string literals, `String` values are **heap-allocated**, mutable, and can grow.
- Example:  
  ```rust
  let mut s = String::from("hello");
  s.push_str(", world!");
  ```

---

### 🔄 Moves vs Copies
- Simple (stack-only) types like integers are **copied** (trivially cheap).
- Heap-based values (`String`, vectors, etc.) are **moved**:
  - After `let s2 = s1;`, `s1` becomes invalid.
  - This prevents **double free errors**.

If you want deep copies, use `.clone()`.

---

### ✅ The `Copy` Trait
- Types with a known size and no special cleanup logic implement `Copy`.
- Examples: integers, floats, `bool`, `char`, tuples of `Copy` types.
- They remain valid after assignment (not moved).

---

### ⚙️ Ownership in Functions
- Passing a variable into a function moves or copies it:
  - Heap data → moved (invalidates the original).
  - Stack-only data (`Copy` types) → copied.
- Returning values also **transfers ownership**.

You can return tuples to keep ownership (but this becomes cumbersome, leading to references in the next section).

---

### 🌟 Big Picture
- Ownership ensures:
  - Memory is freed **exactly once**.
  - No dangling pointers or use-after-free.
  - Safe and efficient memory management without a garbage collector.
